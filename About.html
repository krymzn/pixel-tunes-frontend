        There has been much research to determine what a single color sounds like but that is not as true for gradients, sets of colours such as those we find in everyday images on the internet. Can the color palette of such an image be associated with a musical scale? What does it sound like? Does the sound convey an emotion that resembles the image? These are all questions that PixelTunes potentially aims to answer. A program that reads an uploaded image, extracts the most prominent colours in it and translates them into piano keys.
        PixelTunes' algorithm is based on the work of Alexander Scriabin, a russian pianist of the late 1800s who is rumoured to be one of the first few people to experience Chromesthesia. A condition in which some visual stimuli also trigger the aural senses or vice-versa. This interplay of the human senses allowed him to assign individual pitches to separate colors and PixelTunes is a basic interactable application of the principle he set out to explore
